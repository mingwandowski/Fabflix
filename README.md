## Fabflix

### 1. Intruction

FabFlix is a full stack Java web application provieded a platform for users searching, browsing and shopping the movies they're interested, which imitated Netflix and IMDb for online movies sale.

Uses Micro-service architecture(RESTful API) to make a front-end back-end separation, and uses AJAX and HTTPS to send requests and fetch data from MySQL database. 

Deployed on AWS. In order to avoid the cumbersome access to https, there is another version that uses http requests deployed on my personal [Raspberry Pi](http://71.69.162.72:27373/fabflix/).
