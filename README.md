## Fabflix

### 1. Intruction

FabFlix is a full stack Java web application provieded a platform for users searching, browsing and shopping the movies they're interested, which imitated Netflix and IMDb for online movies sale.

Uses Micro-service architecture(RESTful API) to make a front-end back-end separation, and uses AJAX and HTTPS to send requests and fetch data from MySQL database. 

Implemented Auto-complete search, fuzzy search and full-text search by injected User-defined function into MySQL.

Improved security by implementing Google ReCaptcha, servlet filter, prepared statement for MySQL, database encryption and redirecting to HTTPS.

### 3. Deployed on [AWS](https://3.101.19.225:8443/fabflix/). 

<!-- In order to avoid the cumbersome access to https, there is another version that uses http requests deployed on my personal [Raspberry Pi](http://71.69.162.72:27373/fabflix/). -->
