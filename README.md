## Fabflix

### 1. Intruction

FabFlix is a full stack Java web application provieded a platform for users searching, browsing and shopping the movies they're interested, which imitated Netflix and IMDb for online movies sale.

Uses Micro-service architecture(RESTful API) to make a front-end back-end separation, and uses AJAX and HTTPS to send requests and fetch data from MySQL database. 

Deployed on [AWS](http://52.53.150.120:8080/fabflix/). 

<!-- In order to avoid the cumbersome access to https, there is another version that uses http requests deployed on my personal [Raspberry Pi](http://71.69.162.72:27373/fabflix/). -->
